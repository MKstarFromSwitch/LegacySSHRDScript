# LegacySSHRDScript
A copy of SSHRD_Script for 32-bit iPhones (iPhone only for now)

WARNING: If your iPhone 4S/iPhone 5 is on iOS 8 or lower, use <a href=https://github.com/LukeZGD/Legacy-iOS-Kit>Legacy iOS Kit</a> to create a different ramdisk version. Since the script uses 9.0.2 ramdisk for these devices, you'll run into issues mounting.

### How to run the script
First, install Git if you haven't already:
```shell
sudo apt install git
```

Then, clone the repo:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/MKstarFromSwitch/LegacySSHRDScript.git
cd LegacySSHRDScript
```

And finally, run the script:
```shell
./main.sh
```
